### What is SQL-in? ###
Welcome to SQL-in! This project was a quick solution to building a list of values for a SQL in query from a collection 
using some common or custom delimiters, preventing the user from manually having to create the list for themselves. 

__Features__ :
* Quickly build a SQL IN condition from a delimited list.
* Use either built in or a custom delimiter.
* Option to add quotes
* Option to remove duplicates from the output
* Double click on the output to automatically copy to your clipboard
